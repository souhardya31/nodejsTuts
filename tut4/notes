dependencies - external stuff

npm i nodemon -g
installing nodemon globally


npm init
initialising npm, will create a package.json file after we complete giving all the answers

we use  a .gitignore file to specify files/folder to be ignored when saving to github. In this case we're ignoring the node_modules folder as it's too large

npm i nodemon -D
installing nodemon as devDependencies

devDependencies are used during development
production dependencies(stored as dependencies in package.json) are used in real world/production environments


"uuid": "^9.0.1"
9-major version
0-minor version
1-patch version

^ - can update minor and patch versions
~ - can update patch version only
If we write "uuid": "*" then all updates allowed

use npm uninstall/rm "dependency" to remove a particular dependency, but remember it won't automatically remove the related scripts
